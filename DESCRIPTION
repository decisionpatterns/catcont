Description: This package provides utilities for identifying and testing for 
   whether vectors are categorical or continuos. Functions 'is_cat' and 
   'is_cont' test whether vectors are categorical and continous respectively. 
   Functions 'which_cat' and 'which_cont' identify categorical and continous 
   variables on tables or other recursive objects.
