Description: This collection of methods and utilities allows for a working with
    vectors at a higher level abstraction, i.e. by whether they are 
    categorical (nominal)  or continous. The functions allow for testing, 
    identifying, selecting, mutating,etc. and work with  both 
    atomic vectors and recursive objects (table and list-like) objects in a 
    tidyverse compliant way.
